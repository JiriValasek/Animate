# Animate
An animation FreeCAD workbench

The aim of this workbench is to facilitate an easy way to make animations of your mechanical project.
At this point, it provides 4 tools:

* Server
* Trajectory
* Control
* Collision Detector

Using them you can move objects along trajectories. A trajectory is specified by assigned poses at given times. 
Then you can record this movement into series of images and export as a video afterwards.

## Getting Started, User Guide & Documentation 

All you need to know you'll find out on [Animate website](https://jirivalasek.github.io/Animate/)
So let's go take a look.

## Future plans

The future plans include making 2 simplified trajectory tools - *Rotation* and *Translation*, these tools should be more useful for working with robots and other mechanical systems. Also server focused on working with Animate tools is planned, it should be able to send numbers in their binary form instead of string one.

## License

The Animate workbench (all that is inside *Animate* folde) is licensed under [LGPL license](https://github.com/JiriValasek/Animate/blob/master/Animate/LICENSE). This license does not extend itself to the rest of this repository.
