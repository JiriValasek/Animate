# Animate
An animation FreeCAD workbench

The aim of this workbench is to facilitate an easy way to make animations of your mechanical project.
At this point, it provides 4 tools:

* Server
* Trajectory
* Control
* Collision Detector

Using them you can move objects along trajectories. A trajectory is specified by assigned poses at given times. 
Then you can record this movement into series of images and export as a video afterwards.
