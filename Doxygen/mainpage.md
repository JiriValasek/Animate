Welcome to the documentation {#mainpage}
========================================

Introduction
------------

This documentation of the Animate workbench for FreeCAD was generated by Doxygen. 
The workbench is written in Python3. 
However doxygen cannot be optimized for Python yet and thus please consider all **packages** as python **modules** only.

Documentation description
-------------------------

In this documentation, you'll find detailed description off all tools (`Trajectory`, `Server`, `Control`, `CollisionDetector`, `RobWorld`, `RobRotation` and `RobTranslation`). 
All classes of those tools, their attributes and methods are described in here. 

**What you won't find here is how to use the tools, for that I'd kindly redirect you to the [USER GUIDE](../Guide/getting_started.html)**
